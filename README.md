# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Description

A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that provides an interactive platform to observe
and comprehend the functioning of four popular sorting algorithms: Merge Sort,
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. The visualizer incorporates a speed
slider, enabling users to adjust the animation speed, and it highlights the
elements that are currently being switched during the sorting process.

## Features

- **Merge Sort:** An efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively
  divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps
  through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in
  the wrong order.

- **Selection Sort:** An intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the
  minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the
  first unsorted element.
- **Quick Sort:** An efficient divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the
  array into smaller segments, sorts each segment, and combines them to achieve
  a fully sorted array.

- **Speed Slider:** Allows users to adjust the speed of the sorting animation to
  better visualize the algorithm's behavior.

- **Element Highlighting:** Highlights the elements that are currently being
  switched, providing a clear visual representation of the sorting process.
